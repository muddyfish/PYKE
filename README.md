Pyke is a golfing language designed to be as concise as possible.

Pyke uses a stack based system to achieve this. The Pyke stack is first-in last-out.

Pyke uses a dictionary sorted by frequency in order to compress words. The dictionary itself may be found [here](http://norvig.com/ngrams/count_1w.txt) and the code accomponying the dictionary may be found [here](http://norvig.com/ngrams/). Code copyright (c) 2008-2009 by Peter Norvig.

More documentation and examples can be found [at a pop-con](http://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/44680/showcase-your-language-one-vote-at-a-time/86606#86606), [me saying how great the language is](http://meta.codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/9619/advocate-languages-to-golf-in/9636#9636) and [me showing off the language when first implemented](http://meta.codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/6918/what-programming-languages-have-been-created-by-ppcg-users/8627#8627).

I am perfectly happy to go through with anyone any queries they have about Pyke and will respond eventually if you ping me [here](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/43566/pyke-language)
